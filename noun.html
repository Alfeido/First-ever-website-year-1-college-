    <p>This modestly-sized continent stretches across several climate regions, from hot in the North, through to cold in
        the South.
        <span class="ingredient">The Sacred Grounds</span> sits close to the tectonic boundaries; there are a few
        mountains; and large hills scattered.
        This continent has no volcanoes, and earthquakes recently became common.
        The winds in this region are generally calm, with large storms and extreme weather being common.
        The seas surrounding The Sacred Grounds are often tretcherous.
        Home to a large variety of creatures and plants, and a massive amount of those are found only in this
        region due to <a href="felled star.html">the falling star</a>.

    <h2><b>Shadow Death</b></h2>

    <p>Shadow Death is a sickness, it's name given by Dr H.Lucille, this is because it mimics death, seeking out
        everyone,
        all data regarding how one becomes infected is irradical, anomoalous. In fact it's very existence drove the
        Doctor to madness, he isolates himself
        in an observatory south of the Sacred Grounds.</p>

                    Lanway is a Draegloth, an evil fiend/fey abomination, his race was rare but he himself was rarer, he was born with a blood condition, at first a curse leaving him the runt
                    of his litter. He was left to die to the serpents of Cynan when Dr H Lucille stepped in. He ran experiments on Lanway in an attempt to unlock a new power that could cure 
                    Shadow Death. All tests ended and after 97 logged tests with over one-hundred not logged, Lanway was thrown out again, but changed, he could materialise his blood into one weapon
                    , a bell which he could ring at certain frequencies to afflict various effects on his opponents. He wandered the Sacred Grounds until he encountered a force that granted him
                    the title Lanway The Bellborne, Hand Knight.
