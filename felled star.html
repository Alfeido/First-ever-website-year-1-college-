    <p>The Felled Star is a comet that crashed into the lands millions of years ago. The magic from it reshaped the life on the planet and adjusted how the continents drift
        then came different forms and shapes of life where some inherit the magic but all can learn it. By example of this, the rock that had fallen is buried in the lake of magic.</p>

                <p>
                    The only evidence of the time before the comet was bones dug up and researched, the ideal shape of these creatures was determined through
                    the land. There are people who harness magic of the earth and the earth doesn't forget.

            <p>
                This part of history is slightly easier to understand. Many say that the star healed the earth quickly and new life wasted little time to evolve, all with the capacity
                for large amounts of intelligence.

            <div style="background-color: #000000; height: 300px;"><h2>Dark Age</h2>
                <p>
                    A moment of unclarity in history, where there were predicted to be many small agricultrual settlements but no recorded history from most races. However this is when the
                    Cynan Royal Family was established
                </p>
                </div>
            <div style="background-color: #000000; height: 300px;"><h2>Age Of War</h2>
                <p>As Civilisations progressed there was a capacity for greed, spite jealousy, war broke out, in this age the Iron Order was established.</p>
            </div>
            <div style="background-color: #000000; height: 300px;"><h2>Age Of Peace</h2>
                <p>
                    A moment of peace for the planet, but after 20 years of peace, there came a plague that made everyone take to the Sacred Grounds, but many still hold onto the idea of peace
                    as others prepare for the second Age Of War.
