    <h1><b>The Iron Order</b></h1>

    <p>In the midst of war, King Cynan needed to establish a force to hold people back from the felled star, with soldiers costly to train, and resources limited
        he devised a plan. Armaments melted down and honed to bodies, but they needed a soul, so the queen instructed an old friend, the white masked blacksmith, 
        he raised his hammer and took forth. For one day he spent hitting the comet, trying to break a chunk off, without food, water or sleep, and for 5 days more he continued, before 
        the surface of the comet cracked, when he struck the crack, it erupted with magic and threw him back against the cave wall, but he slowly stood up and strided to the comet against
        to hit the chunk, for six more days he spent hitting it once and being sent back flying, and finally tore a piece off. He carried it to his workshop where he could divide it into many
        many sizes and thus created the iron order, robots powered by magic, warforges.
